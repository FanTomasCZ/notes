#### High-quality export to JPG
Built-in export produces a picture with poor text quality even with "anti-aliasing" turned on. The solution is to export in SVN format, then open it in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) editor. Export to PNG there using `File` > `Export PNG Image...`. :bulb: It might appear at first sight that nothing happens, but look carefully to the right: there should appear a docked tab with export options :).
* Important options:
    * in `Export area` click `Drawing` button to set correct export size
    * in `Image size` set DPI to something like 200
    * in `File name` click `Export As...` button to select a file to export

#### Unsorted
* For groups it's convenient to use `Group` object from `BPMN` palette section (Select node(s) and hold <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> while dragging to move in/out of a group)
